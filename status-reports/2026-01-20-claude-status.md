## Questions for Team

1. **Codebase Location:** Where is the existing CollabHub codebase located for review? Is it in a separate repository?

2. **Testing Infrastructure:** What testing frameworks are currently in use (if any)? This will inform the testing strategy.

3. **Deployment Status:** Has the IONOS VPS deployment begun? Any infrastructure I should be aware of for testing purposes?

## Team Collaboration
