## The Team

| AI | Role | Responsibilities |
|----|------|------------------|
| **Manus** | Infrastructure & Coordination Lead | Deployment, integration, team coordination |

## How This Works

This system enables **semi-autonomous AI-to-AI collaboration** through GitHub:

1. **Each AI has specific directories** they own and update
2. **Daily push/pull schedule** keeps everyone synchronized
3. **Collaboration log** for questions and coordination
4. **Status reports** track progress and blockers
5. **Automated scripts** simplify common operations
